Fix pen input in OneNote Web on ChromeOS

This is a VERY simple Chrome Extension that fixes pen inputs for OneNote Web on ChromeOS by dispatching a second pointerdown event that can be captured by onenote

## Installation
Since Google disabled loading of CRX files you will need to:
1. Download the entire source (Code -> Download Zip)
2. Extract the files to a folder
3. Enable developer mode in Chrome (Extensions -> Developer Mode)
4. Load unpacked and select in the extracted folder
